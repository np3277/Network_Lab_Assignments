Aim:
The objective of this exercise is to understand basic networking concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer, including setting up a simple network, configuring IP addresses, testing peer-to-peer communication, and learning about different types of network cables and their color codes.

 Procedure

 1. Launch Packet Tracer
- Open Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.
- Get acquainted with the Packet Tracer interface, focusing on the workspace, device options, and available tools.

2. Construct a Basic Network
- Drag and drop two computers (PC-PT) onto the workspace.
- Add a switch (Switch-PT) to the workspace.
- Use straight-through Ethernet cables to connect each computer to the switch.

 3. Configure IP Addresses
- Select the first computer, navigate to the Desktop tab, and click on IP Configuration.
- Set the IP address to 192.168.1.1 and the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0.
- Repeat this process for the second computer, assigning it the IP address 192.168.1.2 with the same subnet mask.

 4. Verify Peer-to-Peer Connectivity
- On the first computer, open the Command Prompt from the Desktop tab.
- Execute the `ping` command to check connectivity to the second computer (e.g., `ping 192.168.1.2`).
- Review the results to confirm successful communication between the two computers.

 5. Explore Network Cables and Color Codes
- Inspect the different types of network cables available, such as Ethernet and crossover cables.
- Identify and document the color codes for each wire within these cables:
  - Straight-through Cable: Typically used to connect different types of devices, such as a computer to a switch.
  - Crossover Cable: Generally used to connect similar devices directly, such as computer to computer.

 Methodology
1. Interface Familiarization: Begin by familiarizing yourself with Packet Tracer's interface to ensure ease of use throughout the exercise.
2. Network Setup: Construct a basic network topology using appropriate devices and connections.
3. IP Configuration: Assign IP addresses to each device to ensure they are on the same network and can communicate with each other.
4. Connectivity Testing: Use network tools to verify that the devices can communicate correctly over the network.
5. Cable Analysis: Examine and understand the various cables used in networking, including their color codes and applications.
