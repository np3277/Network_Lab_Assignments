Computer Networks – LAB 5: Static and Default 
Routing 
Objective: 
• To configure static and default routing on routers using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
• To establish communication between different network segments through proper routing 
configurations. 
• To test and verify successful data transfer and connectivity between PCs in different subnets 
using the configured routes. 
Requirements: 
• Cisco Packet Tracer software. 
• A GitHub account and a repository for lab assignments. 
• Access to Google Classroom for submission 
Procedure: 
Network Design: 
• Router1 connected to Router2. 
• PC0 connected to Router1. 
• PC1 connected to Router2. 
Step 1: Configure Network Addresses 
1. Determine IP address scheme: 
• Router1 to Router2 link: 192.168.1.0/30 
• PC0 Network: 192.168.10.0/24 
• PC1 Network: 192.168.20.0/24 
Step 2: Configuring Router1 
1. Select Router1 and open CLI. 
2. Press ENTER to start configuring Router1. 
3. Activate privileged mode: 
• Type enable 
4. Access the configuration menu: 
• Type config t (configure terminal) 
5. Configure interfaces of Router1: 
○ FastEthernet0/0 (connected to PC0): 
• Type interface FastEthernet0/0 
• Configure with the IP address 192.168.10.1 and Subnet mask 255.255.255.0 
○ Serial0/0/0 (connected to Router2): 
• Type interface Serial0/0/0 
• Configure with the IP address 192.168.1.1 and Subnet mask 255.255.255.252 
6. Activate interfaces: 
• Type no shutdown 
Step 3: Configuring Router2 
1. Select Router2 and open CLI. 
2. Press ENTER to start configuring Router2. 
3. Activate privileged mode: 
○ Type enable 
4. Access the configuration menu: 
○ Type config t (configure terminal) 
5. Configure interfaces of Router2: 
○ FastEthernet0/0 (connected to PC1): 
■ Type interface FastEthernet0/0 
■ Configure with the IP address 192.168.20.1 and Subnet mask 255.255.255.0 
○ Serial0/0/0 (connected to Router1): 
■ Type interface Serial0/0/0 
■ Configure with the IP address 192.168.1.2 and Subnet mask 255.255.255.252 
6. Activate interfaces: 
• Type no shutdown 
Step 4: Configuring PCs 
1. Assign IP addresses to each PC: 
○ PC0: 
■ Go to the desktop, select IP Configuration, and assign the following: 
■ IP address: 192.168.10.2 
■ Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 
■ Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1 
○ PC1: 
■ Go to the desktop, select IP Configuration, and assign the following: 
■ IP address: 192.168.20.2 
■ Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 
■ Default Gateway: 192.168.20.1 
Step 5: Static Routing Configuration 
1. Configure static routes on Router1: 
○ Access Router1 CLI and type the following commands: 
■ ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2 
2. Configure static routes on Router2: 
○ Access Router2 CLI and type the following commands: 
■ ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1 
Step 6: Default Routing Configuration 
1. Configure default route on Router1 (if Router1 needs to send packets to networks 
outside its knowledge): 
○ ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.2 
2. Configure default route on Router2 (if Router2 needs to send packets to networks 
outside its knowledge): 
○ ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 
Step 7: Verify Connectivity 
1. Test the connectivity by pinging from PC0 to PC1: 
○ Open the command prompt on PC0. 
○ Type ping 192.168.20.2 and observe the response. 
2. Test the connectivity by pinging from PC1 to PC0: 
○ Open the command prompt on PC1. 
○ Type ping 192.168.10.2 and observe the response. 
Simulation of Designed Network Topology 
Sending a PDU from PC0 to PC1 
1. Open the simulation mode in Packet Tracer. 
2. Send a PDU from PC0 to PC1: 
○ Observe the packet traveling from PC0 to Router1, then Router2, and finally to 
PC1. 
Acknowledgment from PC1 to PC0 
1. Observe the acknowledgment packet: 
○ Ensure that the acknowledgment packet travels back from PC1 to PC0, confirming successful 
communication.
